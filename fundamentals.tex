\subsection{Open-die forging}
Open-die forging is the oldest forging process and can be used to create a variety of final forms. It is an incremental, highly flexible metal forming process primarily used today to prepare cast ingots for further closed-die forging or machining. The process typically involves two dies of simple geometry moving towards one another and thus forming the work piece. Open-die forging processes can be separated into four categories: upsetting, stretch forging, punching and hollow forging. \cite{hbut}

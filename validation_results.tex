\section{Validation}

For the modelling of the described process, different software packages are available. Specifically, DEFORM-3D from Scientific Forming Technologies Corporation,Columbus, USA, FORGE from Transvalor, Mougins, France, and a combination of PEP (Pre- and Postprocessing Environment for Programmers) developed at IBF and LARSTRAN from LASSO Ingenieurgesellschaft mbH, Leinfelden, Germany have been used. These packages differ in their ease of use and freedom in modelling. A comparison of both usability and results will be made here.
